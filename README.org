#+TITLE: SEP: a faster Earley parser

This in an implementation of Earley's parsing algorithm as described in Elizabeth Scott's paper
*SPPF-Style Parsing From Earley Recognizers*.

This parser is intended for work with ambigous grammars, where more than one derivation tree
is expected when parsing a given string. To accomodate this case, the result of the parsing is
represented as a shared packed parse forest (SPPF) instead of a tree.
